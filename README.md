One of my projects required designing 16 types of Overhead Road Gantry Trusses with Road Signage following LTA SDRE standards.
The sheer volume of manual work prompted me to figure out a way to automate this whole process.
After looking into the Programmer Reference to OpenSTAAD Application API and this frame example from the Bentley forum, I managed to develop a Macro for STAAD Pro to automate the entire modeling process.
This saved me a ton of time and ensured consistency across all designs.

Here is a short demonstration video showcasing the STAAD Pro Macro:

Thatâ€™s all for Part 1 of this Macro, up until the modeling part. Part 2 (assigning member properties) and Part 3 (generating loadings) are still on the to-do list!

To save everyone time on these repetitive design tasks, I have decided to share the entire code and make it open-source.
I'm also inviting everyone in the engineering community to contribute their expertise.
Together, we can identify and fix bugs, or even complete the code further.
The ultimate goal is to streamline the design process and liberate our hands from the repetitive work. ðŸ™Œ
